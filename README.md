# Text-Corrector-Python
 This code creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application using Tkinter to correct spelling errors in user-inputted text. It employs the TextBlob library for spelling correction and provides a user-friendly interface with input and output fields, along with a "Check" button to initiate the correction process.

*This is the flowchart for the code.
